I said, "I'd like to know how to get workspaces that are in an errored state and generate the error output from a given terraform run." They replied: One way you could accomplish this would be to: Get the latest run ID for a workspace from this API call https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces#show-workspace Check for the status of said run via this API call https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/run (you can see the possible statuses here https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/run#run-states) Get Plan or Apply IDs as needed, and then obtain the run logs from the associated API calls (Plans https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/plans or applieshttps://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/applies) resulting archivist URLs
