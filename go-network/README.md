Query to ChatGPT: 5/2/2023
How can I write a network server that is similar to netcat where it reads all data from the port and just prints it out. 

What would this look like written in go

How can I make the program interact back with the calling program. 



This program is just a simple program to read any input that comes into a port.
The original purpose was to see the structure of an HTTP request, GET, POST, etc.

The second iteration of the program in GO will be similar to netcat on the server side
which allows the client to connect and type messages back and forth from client to server.

This second part was just for the fun of it to see how long it would take to create it and 
if the automated creation would have errors.

This worked first try on each iteration.
I have not reviewed the code for room for improvements.

Use case: Not many. But this shows how
